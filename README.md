### Implemented Tensorflow library to train models with 10GB, 12 different kinds of pneumonia photos using Google Colab. 
### Implemented Hyperparameter tuning, Random Search tuning, data normalization, data augmentation, dropout to increase validation accuracy, decrease validation loss, got 76 percent confidence of pneumonia prediction after model training process.
